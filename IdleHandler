MessageQueue 静态内部类内部类

MessageQueue 中包含一个 arrayList 存储 addIdleHandler 数据
当 messageQueue 中无 message 或者没有当前时间可执行的 message 时，执行 arrayList 中的 queueIdle

     /**
     * Callback interface for discovering when a thread is going to block
     * waiting for more messages.
     */
    public static interface IdleHandler {
        /**
         * Called when the message queue has run out of messages and will now
         * wait for more.  Return true to keep your idle handler active, false
         * to have it removed.  This may be called if there are still messages
         * pending in the queue, but they are all scheduled to be dispatched
         * after the current time.
         */
        boolean queueIdle();
    }
